Last year less than 10% of students voted so get out and vote.  ASUW has a budget of 1M, so there is a lot of potential for whoever gets the spot. Huskiesunited is trying to focus on cutting HFS food costs, lobbying for protecting undocumented students, helping with international student tuition, which might sound a bit radical, but can be done with this larger budget from ASUW. 

With that being said, even if you don't agree with Huskiesunited's views, the most important thing is just getting up and voting. Thanks!"

Websockets are event driven and have virtually no delay. They are lightweight and ideal for people who want to implement a new "".io"" game or a messaging platform. During the session, we'll get our hands dirty by implementing our own websockets client that communicates with the Discord Gateway and read messages in real time!
Laptops are highly reccomended. 
If you're taking the class, you will get extra credit for attending. Anyone may attend, I don't really mind. However if you're not enrolled in the course you won't get any extra credit points.
