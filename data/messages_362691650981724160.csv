1. Learn basic HTML syntax (and only HTML syntaxes!). Try to create simple static web pages and web sites (using links, a tags). 
2. Learn CSS to stylize your web pages. It's very cast as there are many CSS properties, etc.
3. Go back, refine your HTML syntaxes and how you think your document (web page) should be structured. Now is the chance to incorporate new HTML5 tags (e.g. article, main, aside, etc.) as well as learning how to reference (include) your stylesheets using proper tags. (I discourage the use of inline style declaration).
4. Learn about CSS declarations, HTML syntaxes that make your web page responsive (@media rule) to different device and screen sizes. At this point, you should be able to build a website that looks decent across all browsers and devices and you haven't even touched interactivity yet!
5. Learn Javascript. At this point, learn that the way the language (JS) manipulates your web pages is through the DOM. Learn Javascript syntaxes that manipulates the DOM. Alongside, just learn programming Javascript in general. There shouldn't be a need to learn OOB yet.
6. At this point you should know how to make your web page sufficiently interactive (drop-down menu, let user increase font size, calculate subtotal, etc.).
7. Learn how to use the APIs such as the fetch APIs. The canvas 2d drawing APIs. This is where you get to choose the fun. Because there are lots of them and you can learn different things.
8. At this point, you should have a grasp of how to look for things and shouldn't need anymore steps for client size programming."

I made my closest friends there, and campus was almost empty, so it was a great way to ease into UW. From my experience, everyone seemed to be much nicer / more open during EFS compared to the start of fall quarter, but that's subjective.
The class only takes up the morning, so I had the entire afternoon to do whatever. The class you take can either be pretty easy or damn challenging, but it's nice because there's only 20-30 people in each class. Savor the small class size while you can!
For housing, everyone stays in either Lander or the 2nd/3rd floor of Maple. Local Point has an unlimited buffet-style thing (around $8-$11 per meal)  with way better food compared to the normal year. The RA's are pretty chill, and they do a lot of events throughout EFS (i.e., Lunch on the Ave). 
UPass isn't included unfortunately, that's a separate $75 to pay, but you can just pay at the bus/light rail with cash if you only occasionally use it."

I really regret sticking around at UW for getting into the Informatics program vs. transferring out to Purdue for their CS option. All the classes I took last quarter were hot garbage, the dean doesn't care about how data classes which seem to be the focus of the iSchool's branding are taught, and there's no screening on professors. It's a giant mess- and me as an international student who's forking out about 200k over the course of 4 years feel pretty depressed when I realize I'm majoring in something that makes me a jack of all trades but a master of none. I really regret putting my family through this crap- and myself. To add- I'm currently on the lookout for an internship and aside from hearing a no from almost all the 50+ places I've applied to- I've begun pondering on what have I really learned over the past 3 years and be shocked by the lack of how much I've actually retained. Concepts from a few quarters back are all but fleeting memories now... Why did I ever bother with coming here..."

- When you create `java.awt.Color` objects, a little square of that color will appear in the gutter to show you what the color looks like. Doesn't work if the R, G, and B arguments are variables, might work with expressions that can be evaluated at compile-time.
- You'll get warnings about places where `NullPointerException`s are likely to happen. For example:```java
String s = someString();
if (s == null) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}
```You'll get a warning on `s.toUpperCase()` saying it will throw a NullPointerException.
- Proper theming support, including a dark theme by default
-  Hovering over the right scrollbar, you'll get a preview of the code at that point in the file."

IMO They're not really related. It's calc based physics, but you don't really do calc, ya just need to understand what it means to integrate something that's asymptotic to 0 or infinity. 

phys 122 was my worst grade ever at UW but here I am in EE lol

Reading over the course number system and which courses are eligible for undergraduate exchange students, i'm quite at a loss.

Example:

http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/dxarts.html

I assume, all of the DXARTS 200-800 are all different courses under said category, as as far as i've gathered, it has something to do with the preparations / prerequisites.

Say, DXARTS490,

3-5, max 15. are those credits? why are they not static values?
The description simply says ""taught by UW faculty""  which is not very broad.
 compared to the information i've found here.

Please be civil as this channel is meant to be serious. Bans will be issued to anyone causing problems here. Whether it's major related advice, transferring help, schedule woes, or ranting about tests, feel free to post it here!

- Be respectful, you don't know what others might be going through. 

- If you are thinking about transferring, make sure to talk to an advisor first to discuss all possible options. Take a look at the other UW campuses as well.

- If you are struggling in your classes or are going through a tough time, visit the counseling offices. You're health is much more important than any grade or course. 

- Remember you get one free drop for a course a year. It will show up as a W on your transcript but it might be better than getting a straight F or 0.7. In general, your financial aid will not be taken away if you drop a course as long as you complete 36 credits by the end of the year. This depends on your financial aid package, Talk to an advisor to be sure."
